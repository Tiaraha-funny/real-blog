                The meaning of Vavatenina.
            </h2>
            <p>
                When there were colonisaters here in Madagascar, Vavatenina was still a very small town hidden in the
                forest. Before entered in that town you could see a gate made of some plants called "tenina".
            </p>
            <p>
                Vavahady means <q>gate</q> and <q>Tenina</q> is a kind of plant. They combined those two words and it
                becomes Vavatenina. That is the reason why they call it Vavatenina.
